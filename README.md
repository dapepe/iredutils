CLI Utilities for iRedMail
==========================

Purpose
-------

iRedMail is a great mailserver appliance - I would even go as far and say it's the
best out there. I have been using it for 5+ years.
However, I really prefer the clean and quick way to use a CLI to manage my servers
instead of relying on a web interface. Also, I was missing an open REST API to
create and modify mailboxes.

For this purpose I created a simple set of utilities consisting of a CLI tool
called `iredcli` as well as a REST API to integrate external services. Currently,
the functionality is limited to 


Installation
------------

* Install iRedMail
  - see instructions on [www.iredmail.org](http://www.iredmail.org)
* Install Git:
  - `apt-get install git`
* Clone the repository into `/opt/iredutils/`:
  - `cd /opt`
  - `git clone xxx`
* Install the composer dependencies through `composer`
  - `cd /opt/iredutils/`
  - `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`
  - `php composer.phar install`
* Create a `config.php` file and include your database settings
  - `cp config.template.php config.php`
  - Edit the file and include the database settings for the `vmailadmin` user
  - You can find those settings in the iRedMail.tips file generated by the iRedMail installer
* Create an alias for the `iredcli` command
  - `ln -s /opt/iredutils/iredcli /user/bin/iredcli`

That's it! You can now us the CLI through the `iredcli` command. Have fun!


CLI Usage
---------

### Domains

```
iredcli domain
  show
  add <DOMAIN>
  remove <DOMAIN>
  export
  import <FILENAME>
```


### Mailbox

```
iredcli mailbox
  show [<DOMAIN> --search=<SEARCH>]
  add <EMAIL> [--password=<PASSWORD> --maildir=<MAILDIR>]
  update <EMAIL> [--password=<PASSWORD>]
  remove <EMAIL>
  export [<DOMAIN> --search=<SEARCH>]
  import <FILENAME>
```

### Alias

```
iredcli alias
  show [<DOMAIN|EMAIL> --search=<SEARCH>]
  add <ALIAS> <MAILBOX>
  remove <ALIAS> [<MAILBOX>]
  export [<DOMAIN|EMAIL> --search=<SEARCH>]
  import <FILENAME>
```


Importing data
--------------

You can import data through JSON. The JSON format for each individual endpoint is as follows:

### Domains

```json
[
  {
    "domain": "acme.com"
  },
  ...
]
```

Alternative:

```json
[
  "acme.com",
  ...
]
```


### Mailbox

```json
[
  {
    "username": "mailbox1@acme.com",
    "password": "xxx",
    "maildir": "acme.com/m/a/i/..."
  },
  ...
]
```

`maildir` is an optional parameter. If not supplied, a directory will be created.
Instead of `password` you can also supply a parameter called `hash` with the
hashed password instead.


### Alias

```json
[
  {
    "address": "alias@alias.com",
    "goto": "mailbox1@acme.com,mailbox2@acme.com"
  },
  ...
]
```
