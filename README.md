iRedUtils: CLI and REST API for iRedMail
========================================

Purpose
-------

iRedMail is a great mailserver appliance - I would even go as far and say it's the
best out there. I have been using it for 5+ years.
However, I really prefer the clean and quick way to use a CLI to manage my servers
instead of relying on a web interface. Also, I was missing an open REST API to
create and modify mailboxes.

For this purpose I created a simple set of utilities consisting of a CLI tool
called `iredcli` as well as a REST API to integrate external services. It certainly
does not cover the full stack of the iRedAdmin Pro interface, but for me it gets the
job done.


Installation
------------

* Install iRedMail
  - see instructions on [www.iredmail.org](http://www.iredmail.org)
* Install Git:
  - `apt-get install git`
* Clone the repository into `/opt/iredutils/`:
  - `cd /opt`
  - `git clone https://github.com/zeyosinc/iredutils.git`
* Install the composer dependencies through `composer`
  - `cd /opt/iredutils/`
  - `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`
  - `php composer.phar install`
* Create a `config.php` file and include your database settings
  - `cp config.template.php config.php`
  - Edit the file and include the database settings for the `vmailadmin` user
  - You can find those settings in the iRedMail.tips file generated by the iRedMail installer
* Create an alias for the `iredcli` command
  - `ln -s /opt/iredutils/iredcli /usr/bin/iredcli`

That's it! You can now us the CLI through the `iredcli` command and access the REST API. Have fun!

In case you want to use the REST API, you need to perform some additional steps:

1. Create an Apache configuration file in `/etc/apache2/conf-available/iredutilsapi.conf`:

```
<Directory /opt/iredutils>
    DirectoryIndex api.php
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

Next, enable the configuration by typing `a2enconf iredutilsapi`.

After this, edit the SSL site settings by opening the file `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf`:

```
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/api/?(.*) /opt/iredutils/api.php/$1
```

Before restarting the web server, make sure that mod_rewrite is enabled: `a2enmod rewrite`.

Now, restart your webserver by typing `service apache2 restart`


REST Endpoints
--------------

### GET: /domain

List domains


### POST: /domain/:domainname

Creates a new domain


CLI Usage
---------

### Domains

```
iredcli domain
  show
  add <DOMAIN>
  remove <DOMAIN>
  export
  import <FILENAME>
```

### Mailbox

```
iredcli mailbox
  show [<DOMAIN> --search=<SEARCH>]
  add <EMAIL> [--password=<PASSWORD> --maildir=<MAILDIR>]
  update <EMAIL> [--password=<PASSWORD>]
  remove <EMAIL>
  export [<DOMAIN> --search=<SEARCH>]
  import <FILENAME>
```

### Alias

```
iredcli alias
  show [<DOMAIN|EMAIL> --search=<SEARCH>]
  add <ALIAS> <MAILBOX>
  remove <ALIAS> [<MAILBOX>]
  export [<DOMAIN|EMAIL> --search=<SEARCH>]
  import <FILENAME>
```

### Alias

```
iredcli policy
  show [<POLICYGROUP> --search=<SEARCH>]
  add <POLICYGROUP> <MEMBER>
  remove <POLICYGROUP> <MEMBER>
  learn <ham|spam|forget> <FILE>
```


Importing data
--------------

You can import data through JSON. The JSON format for each individual endpoint is as follows:

### Domains

```json
[
  {
    "domain": "acme.com"
  },
  ...
]
```

Alternative:

```json
[
  "acme.com",
  ...
]
```


### Mailbox

```json
[
  {
    "username": "mailbox1@acme.com",
    "password": "xxx",
    "maildir": "acme.com/m/a/i/..."
  },
  ...
]
```

`maildir` is an optional parameter. If not supplied, a directory will be created.
Instead of `password` you can also supply a parameter called `hash` with the
hashed password instead.


### Alias

```json
[
  {
    "address": "alias@alias.com",
    "goto": "mailbox1@acme.com,mailbox2@acme.com"
  },
  ...
]
```


Examples
--------

```
./iredcli domain add test.com
./iredcli mailbox add demo@test.com
./iredcli mailbox add test@test.com
./iredcli mailbox add helo@test.com
./iredcli alias add alias2@test.com test@test.com
./iredcli alias add alias@test.com test@test.com
./iredcli alias add alias@test.com demo@test.com
./iredcli alias show
./iredcli mailbox show
./iredcli alias remove alias@test.com demo@test.com
./iredcli alias show
./iredcli mailbox remove test@test.com
./iredcli domain remove test.com
./iredcli mailbox remove test.com --search=.
```



Contributing
------------

Please note that this is a side project for me and was mainly created to "skratch my own itch", so
I only maintain it to the degree that I require it to work for my purposes. If you find any bugs
of you have ideas for new features, be a sweatheart and simply send me a pull request. Cheers!
